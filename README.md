# Running Unit Tests

Junit 4 was used for these tests. If junit is not part of your devsetup, some IDEs come with the option of allowing you to add JUnit to your library. If this is not an option, download junit-4.13.2.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar from https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Download-and-Install and add them to your classPath. To run the tests simply run the test file from your preferred IDE.
